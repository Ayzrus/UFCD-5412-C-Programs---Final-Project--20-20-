## üéØ Overview

This project is a menu-driven C application that combines six different programs into a single educational system. It was developed as part of the UFCD 5412 curriculum and demonstrates various programming concepts including input validation, data processing, string manipulation, and basic game development.

## üõ† Programs Included

1. **Balance Calculator** - Financial balance computation tool
2. **Travel Expense Manager** - Budget vs actual expense tracker
3. **IPv4 Address Classifier** - Network address classification utility
4. **Email Validator (.pt)** - Portuguese domain email validation
5. **Currency Converter** - Multi-currency exchange calculator
6. **Simplified Snake Game** - Console-based snake game

## üîß Prerequisites

- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Standard C library support
- Terminal/Console environment

## üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayzrus/UFCD-5412-C-Programs---Final-Project--20-20-.git
cd UFCD-5412-C-Programs---Final-Project--20-20-
```

2. Compile the program:

```bash
gcc -o test_system main.c
```

3. Run the executable:

```bash
./test_system
```

## üöÄ Usage

After running the program, you'll see a main menu with 6 options plus an exit option. Simply enter the number corresponding to the program you want to use:
